Problem and Motivation
----------------------

Behaviors, provided by the ``plone.behavior`` package, provide a very useful
way of extending the functionality of a Dexterity content type. Unfortunately,
the fact that a content type's behaviors are stored in its factory contents
information (FTI) inside the portal_types tool, means that they are class
(or type) specific, and not instance specific. This means that behaviors can
only be enabled globally, in other words only for all the instances of a
specific type.

To enable per instance behaviors, we need a way to store those behaviors
on the instance. We use annotations for this purpose.

Additionally We provide our own ``IBehaviorAssignable`` adapter that overrides
the default one to not only look for an object's FTI registered annotations,
but also look for the behaviors stored in the current instance's annotations.

Also helper functions are implemented which can be used to dynamically assing
behaviors and interfaces on dexterity content objects.


Installation
------------

Depend your plone product on ``collective.instancebehavior``.


Enable behaviors and interfaces
-------------------------------

::

    >>> from plone.app.event.dx.interfaces import IDXEvent
    >>> enable_behaviors(obj, ['plone.app.event.dx.behaviors.IEventBasic',],
    ...                       [IDXEvent,])


Disable behaviors and interfaces
--------------------------------

::

    >>> from plone.app.event.dx.interfaces import IDXEvent
    >>> disable_behaviors(obj, ['plone.app.event.dx.behaviors.IEventBasic',],
    ...                        [IDXEvent,])

    12:13 < rnix> datakurre: woring instance behavior enabled add form
    12:21 < rnix> datakurre: may be generalized to collective.instancebehavior -> just need a generic way on telling DX to use the correct form. -> idea would be to have a 
                  behavior which can be bound to folderish objects and this defined default behaviors applied dynamically
    12:21 < rnix> to it's direct children
    12:22 < rnix> but i do not really like to register this add view for every type.. would be more appropriate if we found a way on 
    12:22 < rnix> deciding by applied container interface
    12:22 < rnix> something like that...
    12:26 < datakurre> rnix: What the differences for original add form? 1) show fields for default instance behaviors 2) enable default instance behaviors on save?
    12:28 < datakurre> rnix: 2) Could probably be done by instancebehavior-adapter (add form would call it, when instancebehavior-behavior is enabled)
    12:28 < datakurre> rnix: 1) migth be possible with plone.z3cform's FormExtender
    12:30 < rnix> datakurre: i was thinking of an IChildDefaultInstanceBehaviors behavior, which reads the available IInstanceBehavior deriving definitions. and sets them to 
                  all added children by default
    12:30 < rnix> the add view can then be bound to IChildDefaultInstanceBehaviors
    12:31 < datakurre> rnix: Well, that works for sure.
    12:32 < rnix> datakurre: instead of binding the add view by name to Products.CMFCore.interfaces.IFolderish, we bind it to IChildDefaultInstanceBehaviors without name...
